### Description
-----------

* **SARS-CoV-2 evolution in human hosts**. ntEdit v1.3.4 was used to map nucleotide variation between the first published coronavirus isolate from Wuhan in early January and over 195,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled from around the globe during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
